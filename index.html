          Before beginning his career in banking, Abubakar
          gained valuable experience in public service. He worked with the Sokoto Rima River Basin Development Authority
          (SRRBDA), where he contributed to regional agricultural and water management programs, and later joined
          the Nigerian Air Force in 1985, where he developed discipline, leadership, and teamwork skills that would shape his later career.
          Abubakar began his banking career at Afribank Nigeria Plc (1991–1999) as a Senior Officer before joining Standard Trust Bank (later UBA),
          where he rose through the ranks to become Branch Manager, Sector Head, and Group Head between 1999 and 2005.
          In 2005, he joined Zenith Bank Plc, where his managerial excellence, professional integrity, and relationship-building
           skills earned him successive promotions  from Senior Relationship Manager to Assistant General Manager (AGM), then Deputy General Manager
           (DGM), and now General Manager (GM) and Zonal Head. In these roles, he has provided strategic direction, managed multi-state operations,
           and driven sustainable growth across Northern Nigeria.
          He is deeply committed to public service and national development, Abubakar is passionate about improving lives through effective financial
          management and developmental initiatives. He has a special interest in Conflict Resolution in the Developing World, an area in which
          he intends to pursue a Ph.D., reflecting his dedication to peacebuilding and social progress.
          He has received several recognitions, including the Kano State NYSC Honours Award and the Presidential National Honours Award.
          He has also attended numerous local and international management programs, such as Credit Risk Evaluation by Pimpley & Pimpley,
          Leading High-Performance Sales Teams (TDS), and the Management Development Programme (LBS) at the Lagos Business School.
